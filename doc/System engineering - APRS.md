# APRS payload - Concept

 ## Need
- To track rockets during descent and help recovery by identifying the location after landing

## Stake holders
- Rocketry control system 
- FCC 
- Additions due to NEBP
	- NEBP & WVBEAR -  (Added as an alternate user after the initial design)
	- FAA
	- Science Payload (Addition after PAGSO grant acceptance)

---
## Constraints 

- Weight:
	- Based on the specification of NEBP payload design 350 g
- Physical Dimensions:
	- need to be able to fit inside a 3.5 inch rocket. 
	- Have a thermal insulation (High altitude use - NEBP)
- Operational altitude
	- 10 km - from Rocketry
	- 30 km - from NEBP HAB requirements 
- Power -  5v (2s Li-ion/Li-Po)
- Standalone and paired operation modes
- FCC requirements: [47 CFR 97.307(e)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-47/part-97#p-97.307(e))
	- data down link. (uplink added as a Science requirement)
